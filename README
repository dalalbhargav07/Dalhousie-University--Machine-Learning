# Dalhousie---Machine-Learning-with-Big-Data Course:


Course Description:
-------------------
This course was an **introduction to machine learning, including their practical use and theoretical foundation**. It emphasized **probabilistic and deep learning methods**, and used Python with advanced implementations such as sklearn and Google's Tensorflow. It was started by showing how to apply pre-programmed algorithms in Python to get some practical experience before unpacking some of the theory behind them. The course included introductory reviews of scientific programming with Python.

Learning Outcomes:
------------------
* To be able to write Python programs to apply machine learning algorithms including the use of sklearn, tensorflow, and basic algorithms from scratch.
* Explaining a learning algorithms including a gradient descent method.
* Explaining techniques for validation and hyperparameter tuning.
* Describe modeling and regression in a probabilistic framework.
* Explain a Bayesian network and causal models.
* Explain the difference of maximum likelihood estimation and maximum a-posteriori and itâ€™s limi-tation.
* Explain overfitting and different regularization techniques.
* Apply gradient descent learning to a multilayer perceptron.
* Calculate convolutions.
* Apply deep learning methods to supervised and unsupervised learning problems.
* Explain reinforcement learning including model-based and model-free methods.
* Apply Bellman equations and Temporal Difference Learning.
* Apply function approximator to reinforcement learning.
* Explain and implement recurrent network including gated RNNs.



Thanks to **Dr. Thomas Trappenberg** for desiging and teaching the course well.
